                <h1>Dart history</h1>
                <p>
                    Dart 1.0 was released on November 14th, 2013 by Google and was founded by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund.
                    It aims to help developers build modern web and mobile applications. It covers client, server, and
                    now mobile with Flutter. Coming with a range of tools including a virtual machine, core libraries
                    and package management repository, it lends enough ammunition for you to get started on your next
                    project.
                </p>
                <h1>Dart is Object-Oriented</h1>
                <p>
                    Smalltalk was released in the 1970s and was one of the first pure object-oriented programming
                    languages. You can now find object-oriented programming everywhere. It has dominated the world of
                    programming languages.</p>

                <p> The concept behind object-oriented programming is quite simple: all but the most trivial programs
                    require a particular form of structure.</p>

                <p> The most clear-cut way of achieving this particular structure is by using the concept of storage
                    containers. A programming language can be divided into data and operations to be performed on data.
                    We can store specific data and operations in some type of container. Furthermore, these containers
                    are made to be general. Hence, they not only store data and operations but they are themselves
                    values that can be stored in other containers and passed as parameters to other operations. In
                    object-oriented programming, these containers are known as objects.</p>

                <p>Alan Kay, the inventor of Smalltalk, remarked that in this way the simplest object has the same
                    construction principle as a full computer: it combines data with operations under a formalized
                    interface.</p>

                <p> And now, even though object-oriented programming can be found in a multitude of languages, very few
                    actually follow the principles set by Smalltalk. Dart, on the other hand, is a pure object-oriented
                    programming language with every value being an object.</p>
                </p>
                <h1>Dart: Through the Eyes of JavaScript </h1>
                <p>
                    Dart is a clean, simple, class-based object-oriented language that has more structure than
                    JavaScript, the programming language it is heavily based on. It’s great for developers that are
                    interested in having a structure in their programming language so that they can easily do
                    refactoring and build large web applications.</p>

                <p> According to the founders, one of the things they focused on while creating the language is that it
                    be compatible with the web. Hence, one of the most important components is the Dart to JavaScript
                    compiler. It translates the Dart source code to JavaScript and ensures that you get the same
                    semantics as if you run it on top of the JavaScript virtual machine.</p>

            <article>
                <p>
                    Flutter has been able to grab the attention of the development community by introducing a style that
                    allows for expressive liberty making it a joy to build UIs for mobile apps. It incorporates certain
                    concepts familiar to modern development experiences like reactive programming and widget composition
                    while using the Dart platform as its main base of operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Flutter team evaluated more than a dozen languages and picked Dart because it matched the way
                    they were building user interfaces. Let’s see what Dart offers and why it was chosen by Flutter.
                </p>
                <h1>Optimized for UI</h1>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Asynchronous operations let your program complete work while waiting for another operation
                            to finish. Here are some common asynchronous operations:

                        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
                            <li>Fetching data over a network</li>
                            <li>Writing to a database </li>
                            <li>Reading data from a file </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Most computers, even on mobile platforms, have multi-core CPUs. To take advantage of all those
                        cores, developers traditionally use shared-memory threads running concurrently. However,
                        shared-state concurrency is error-prone and can lead to complicated code. Instead of threads,
                        all Dart code runs inside of isolates. Each isolate has its own memory heap, ensuring that no
                        isolate’s state is accessible from any other isolate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A programming language optimized for building user interfaces with features for expanding
                        collections, and for customizing the UI for each platform.

                <h1>Variable</h1>
                <p>
                    Variable is named storage location and Data types simply refers to the type and size of
                    data associated with variables and functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dart uses var keyword to declare the variable. The syntax of var is defined below,
                    <code>var x = 42.</code>
                <p>The final and const keyword are used to declare constants. They are defined as below:</p>
                <code>void main() {
                    final a = 12;
                    const pi = 3.14;
                    print(a);
                    print(pi);
                   }</code>

                <h1>Data Type</h1>
                <p>
                    Data types can be found all around us; numbers, alphabets, or characters which are classified based
                    on the similar properties they share.<br>
                    Dart language supports the following data types:

                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                    <li>Numbers: It is used to represent numeric literals – Integer and Double.</li>
                    <li>Strings: It represents a sequence of characters. String values are specified in either
                        single or double quotes.</li>
                    <li>Booleans: Dart uses the bool keyword to represent Boolean values – true and false.</li>
                    <li>Lists and Maps: It is used to represent a collection of objects. </li>
                    <li>Dynamic: If the variable type is not defined, then its default type is dynamic.</li>
                </ul>

            <header>Decision Making and Loops</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    A decision making block evaluates a condition before the instructions are executed. Dart
                    supports If, If..else and switch statements.<br>
                    Loops are used to repeat a block of code until a specific condition is met. Dart supports
                    for, for..in , while and do..while loops.<br>
                    Let us understand a simple example about the usage of control statements and loops:
                    <code>
                            void main() {
                                for( var i = 1 ; i <= 10; i++ ) {
                                if(i%2==0)
                                {
                                print(i);
                                }
                                }
                               }
                               
                        </code>
                    The above code prints the even numbers from 1 to 10.

            <article>
                <p>
                    A function is a group of statements that together performs a specific task. Let us look into
                    a simple function in Dart as shown here:

                    <code>
                        void main() {
                            add(3,4);
                           }
                           void add(int a,int b) {
                            int c;
                            c=a+b;
                            print(c);
                           }
                                   
                            </code>
                            The above function adds two values and produces 7 as the output

            <article>
                <p>
                    Dart is an object-oriented language. It supports object-oriented programming features like
                    classes, interfaces, etc.<br>
                    A class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class definition includes the following:
                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                        <li>Fields</li>
                        <li>Getters and setters</li>
                        <li>Constructors</li>
                        <li>Functions </li>
                    </ul>
                    Now, let us create a simple class using the above definitions:
                    <code>
                        class Employee {
                            String name;
                            //getter method
                            String get emp_name {
                            return name;
                            }
                           
                            //setter method
                            void set emp_name(String name) {
                            this.name = name;
                            }
                           
                            //function definition
                            void result()
                            {
                            print(name);
                            }
                           
                           }
                           void main() {
                            //object creation
                            Employee emp = new Employee();
                            emp.name="employee1";
                            emp.result(); //function call

                            </code>
